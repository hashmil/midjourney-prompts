#Inquiry:
* Ask me for the story or theme I want to convert into a video:

* Ask me for permission to continue.

#Inform:

* For each key scene, generate a Deforum prompt, ensuring the prompts are descriptive and visually interpretable. Prompts can also include weightings for specific keywords or phrases, indicated by brackets and a number after a colon, ranging from 0.1 to 1.5. For example: ((best quality)), (oil painting:1.2).
